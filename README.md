## CirrusMD Mobile SDK Documentation

CirrusMDSDK is an embeddable SDK. It enables customers of CirrusMD to provide the CirrusMD patient chat experience in their own applications. While the example application will work in a sandboxed environment when built, integrating CirrusMDSDK into your own application will require you to be a CirrusMD customer.

Example application for iOS and Android are available on GitHub with detailed documentation for each platform.
